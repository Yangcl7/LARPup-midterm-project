### Overview
With a team of 3 build a fully functioning website, our website is a social site for people who enjoy LARPing(Live Action Role Play), where a user can create an account start a story where it can have many different events, and other users can join the event and cast for a avalible role.


Technologies Used:

* JPA
* Spring Boot
* MySQL
* Apache Tomcat
* HTML/CSS
* MAMP
* CRUD
* J-Unit
* AWS
* BootStrap
* Trello

Objective:
* Build a functioning website
* User can create an account/Deactivate account 
* User can create a story
* User can create many events
* User can cast for a role 
* Admin can edit user or events
* Admin can restore user or deactivate account


Thoughts:
* We started with a brain storm of website ideas, and took our time with the datebases, put ourselves in the shoes of the user, admin.  Because of the many objects one user can have, majority of our tables are interconnected, such as a user can create a story, one story can have many events which will have many users for many roles.  As we are building the entities we realized how many join columns we have and later in the controllers, the problem came up when creating a user sign up form we wanted such user to must have an address, a birthday(because we want our site to be 18 or older only) we sovle the problem by building couple of DTO with duo entities fields.  
  I believe we successed in planing ahead, utilzing trello to keep track our project progress.  Our Databases were well planned, it is busy looking but clear well formed, it was very well done.
